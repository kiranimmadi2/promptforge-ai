/// Resource for Batch API operations.
///
/// Batch processing allows you to send large volumes of requests asynchronously,
/// with results available once processing completes. This is useful for:
/// - Processing large datasets
/// - Running overnight jobs
/// - Cost optimization (batch requests are often discounted)
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // 1. Upload a JSONL file with requests
/// final file = await client.files.upload(
///   file: inputFile,
///   purpose: FilePurpose.batch,
/// );
///
/// // 2. Create a batch job
/// final job = await client.batch.jobs.create(
///   request: CreateBatchJobRequest(
///     inputFiles: [file.id],
///     endpoint: '/v1/chat/completions',
///     model: 'mistral-small-latest',
///   ),
/// );
///
/// // 3. Poll for completion
/// while (!job.isComplete) {
///   await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 30));
///   job = await client.batch.jobs.retrieve(jobId: job.id);
///   print('Progress: ${job.progress}%');
/// }
///
/// // 4. Download results
/// if (job.outputFileId != null) {
///   final results = await client.files.download(fileId: job.outputFileId!);
///   // Process results...
/// }
/// ```
